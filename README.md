# dna-sequence-classifier
A machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts the gene type from a DNA sequence. It uses one-hot encoding and a trained Random Forest classifier to accurately identify the class of biological DNA sequences.

# 🧬 DNA Sequence Classifier

This is a web app that classifies DNA sequences into gene types using a trained machine learning model (Random Forest). The model supports one-hot encoded DNA input and predicts the gene class with high accuracy.
